# Behavior
---

This is repository of code with functions that I use to perform data analysis and visualization of behavioral data. This is in constant development and by no means complete. Documentation is added as needed.


# Requirements


## Python

All the software is written in python or python jupyter notebooks. In order to have access to them, I recommend installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).   
Please install the version with Python 3.7 (Anaconda distribution is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux).
64-Bit Graphical Installer (466 MB)


## Git

Git is a version control system very useful to work collaboratively on projects. There is a great tutorial on [Data Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

To install, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (available for MacOS, Windows and Linux).
